Weight Tracking App

This application is designed to mangage weight tracking goals by allowing the user to set a goal weight then record daily updates. once the goal weight has been reached an alert is sent to the user.

Application includes a login/sign up page that allows you to create a new user account then sign in.
A main page allows you to view your goal and tracked weights while a floating button allows you to add new weights
A final screen is provided for managering the notifcation settings.

I tried to test my code after every update to make sure it was fully functional before moving on to a new feature.

My biggest challege was coming up with a solution for creating an account and signing in on the same screen. i used fragments to show and hide the appropriate screens when needed. My succesful demonstration was to due to how the application handled SQL light as i was able to create and manage data withen it efficently.
